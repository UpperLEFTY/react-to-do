### This is a repository for a React Todo application using only functional components and Hooks to manage state. 

To run the application, cd to the project directory and run the following commands:
$ npm install
$ npm start or yarn start

Built With
React - JavaScript framework.

# I wanted display my knowledge of hooks to show that we're able to use state inside the functional components to prevent re-calculating it every time the component updates. It provides improved code reuse, composition, and better defaults. Rather than use complicated multi-line if-else statements, I felt my code could be simplified by using more concise methods by using ternary expressions, I feel like it made the conditional rendering much easier than with a tradtional if-else statements. Within this app you should be able to add tasks, delete tasks and remove tasks. I didn't do much styling in the app with specifics, although I should have.
